#in this task, we will complete the dna seq, A match to T, and C match to G, you can find more information about Complementing in ROSALIND website along with this task
s = "AAAACCCGGT"
#set a DNA_reverse seq variable to add the new matching to s DNA seq
s_reverse = ""

#loop around DNA seq to match it with the complementray letter for each nucletide 
for i in s:
   if i == "A":
   s_reverse = s_reverse + "T":
if i == "T":
   s_reverse = s_reverse + "A":
if i == "C":
   s_reverse = s_reverse + "G":
if i == "G":
   s_reverse = s_reverse + "C":

#after finnishing matching, you need to know that the complementary must be from 3' to '5, you should reverse the result
#print it with reverse result
print(s_reverse[::-1])

#-1 make the result start from the end
