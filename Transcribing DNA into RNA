#In this Task, we are going to Transcrib DNA to RNA
#You can find more information about Transcribing and the diffrance between DNA and RNA in ROSALIND website along with this problem description
#However, RNA got "U" for Uracil inested of "T" for Thymine in DNA
#Start by stting up our DNA seq for a varible called s, notice it got "T"

s = "GATGGAACTTGACTACGTAAATT"
#set a varible to store the new RNA seq that will transcript from DNA
RNA_seq = ""

#loop around s, your DNA seq, if you notice "T" for Thymine, add Uracil or "U" for the RNA_seq, the seq that you will generte, but if you loop it and did not notice T, you can
#add the same letter that you found in DNA seq to your RNA seq.
